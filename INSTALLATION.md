## Fluent Forms Setup

### Finding Your Form ID

1. Go to `Fluent Forms` > `All Forms` in WordPress admin
2. Find your target form in the list
3. Note the ID number in the first column
4. Alternatively, edit the form and check the URL - the ID is in the address

### Setting Up Date Fields

For each Fluent Form you want to target:

1. **Edit Your Form**
   - Go to `Fluent Forms` > `All Forms`
   - Click `Edit` on your target form

2. **Add Date Fields** (if not already present)
   - Add two "Date/Time" fields from the form builder
   - Position them where you want check-in and check-out dates

3. **Configure Field Names**
   - Click on the first date field
   - Go to `Input Customization` tab
   - Set the **Name Attribute** to match your restriction settings (e.g., `checkin`)
   - Repeat for the second field with the check-out name (e.g., `checkout`)

4. **Field Settings Recommendations**
   - **Date Format**: Use `Y-m-d` for consistency
   - **Enable Time**: Only if you need time selection
   - **Required**: Set as required for booking forms

5. **Save Your Form**
   - Click `Save Form` to apply changes

## Multi-Form Setup

### Managing Multiple Restrictions

You can create unlimited calendar restrictions for different purposes:

1. **Different Room Types**
   ```
   "Room A Bookings" â†’ Form ID 3, fields: room_a_checkin/room_a_checkout
   "Room B Bookings" â†’ Form ID 4, fields: room_b_checkin/room_b_checkout
   "Suite Bookings"  â†’ Form ID 5, fields: suite_checkin/suite_checkout
   ```

2. **Different Services**
   ```
   "Equipment Rental"  â†’ Form ID 6, fields: rental_start/rental_end
   "Event Booking"     â†’ Form ID 7, fields: event_start/event_end
   "Consultation"      â†’ Form ID 8, fields: consult_start/consult_end
   ```

3. **Seasonal Configurations**
   ```
   "Summer Bookings"   â†’ Form ID 9, different disabled dates
   "Winter Bookings"   â†’ Form ID 10, different disabled dates
   ```

### Multiple Forms on Same Page

The plugin automatically handles multiple forms on the same page:
- Each form operates independently
- No conflicts between different restrictions
- Clear buttons are form-specific
- Debug logging helps troubleshoot issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calendar Restrictions menu not visible**
- Verify Fluent Forms is installed and activated
- Check for PHP errors in your error logs
- Deactivate and reactivate the plugin

**Frontend restrictions not working**
- Enable `WP_DEBUG` in `wp-config.php` for detailed logging
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Form ID and field names match exactly
- Ensure the restriction is published (not draft)

**Date picker not appearing**
- Check that Fluent Forms is properly loaded on the page
- Verify field names match between restriction and form
- Check for JavaScript conflicts with other plugins

**Multiple forms interfering**
- Each restriction should have unique Form IDs
- Field names can be the same across different forms
- Check console logs for configuration details

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

1. **Enable WordPress Debug**
   ```php
   // Add to wp-config.php
   define('WP_DEBUG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for GDB messages
   - Look for configuration and error details

3. **Debug Information Available**
   - Number of configurations loaded
   - Form detection results
   - Field matching results
   - Restriction application status

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations Built-in**
- Scripts only load when configurations exist
- Efficient CPT queries with meta query filtering
- Form-specific loading prevents unnecessary processing
- Minimal DOM manipulation

**Best Practices**
- Limit disabled dates to necessary dates only
- Use descriptive restriction titles for easy management
- Regularly review and clean up unused restrictions
- Test changes on staging environment first
