## [2.0.0] - 2024-05-30

### ðŸš€ MAJOR UPDATE - Complete Architectural Redesign

Version 2.0.0 introduces a complete rewrite from single global settings to a flexible Custom Post Type (CPT) system, enabling unlimited calendar restriction configurations.

### Added
- **Custom Post Type System**: New `gdb_restriction` CPT for managing multiple calendar restrictions
- **Multi-Configuration Support**: Create unlimited calendar restrictions, each targeting different Fluent Forms
- **Enhanced Admin Interface**: 
  - WordPress native CPT management interface
  - Meta boxes for restriction settings and disabled dates
  - Flatpickr calendar integration in meta boxes
  - Form targeting configuration per restriction
- **Multi-Form Page Support**: Multiple forms on the same page work independently without conflicts
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Scripts only load when valid configurations exist
  - Efficient CPT queries with meta query filtering
  - Form-specific loading prevents unnecessary processing
- **Enhanced Debug Capabilities**:
  - Detailed console logging when WP_DEBUG is enabled
  - Configuration loading status and form detection results
  - Debug object with utilities for troubleshooting
- **Unique Form Instance Management**: Each form gets its own scoped variables and picker instances
- **Independent Clear Buttons**: Form-specific clear buttons with unique IDs to prevent conflicts
- **Advanced Form Detection**: Improved selectors for BricksExtras and standard Fluent Forms integration

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete architectural change from global settings to Custom Post Type system
- **Data Storage**: Moved from `wp_options` to `post_meta` storage for better scalability
- **Admin Interface**: Replaced Settings page with CPT management interface
- **Frontend JavaScript**: Complete refactor to handle multiple configurations simultaneously
- **Form Targeting**: Each restriction now independently targets specific forms
- **Date Management**: Per-restriction disabled dates instead of global disabled dates
- **Configuration Loading**: Dynamic query-based configuration loading instead of static options
- **Field Scoping**: Form-specific variable scoping prevents cross-form interference

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Old global settings system completely deprecated
- **Settings Page**: Removed "Settings > Global Date Blocker" admin page
- **Global Options**: No longer uses `gdb_form_id`, `gdb_checkin_field`, `gdb_checkout_field`, `gdb_disabled_dates` options
- **Single Configuration Limitation**: No longer limited to one form configuration

### Improved
- **Scalability**: Support for unlimited calendar restrictions vs single global configuration
- **User Experience**: More intuitive WordPress-native admin interface
- **Performance**: More efficient resource loading and form detection
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure following WordPress best practices
- **Security**: Enhanced nonce verification and capability checks for CPT operations
- **Error Handling**: Better validation and error reporting throughout the system

### Technical Details
- **Post Type**: `gdb_restriction` with proper labels, capabilities, and menu integration
- **Meta Fields**:
  - `_gdb_form_id`: Target Fluent Form ID (integer)
  - `_gdb_checkin_field_name`: Check-in field name (string)
  - `_gdb_checkout_field_name`: Check-out field name (string)
  - `_gdb_disabled_dates`: Array of disabled dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Frontend Configuration**: Dynamic array passed via `wp_localize_script` as `gdbFrontendConfigs`
- **Form Instance Management**: Scoped variables per form ID to prevent conflicts
- **Event Handling**: Enhanced Fluent Forms event integration for dynamic form loading

### Migration Notes
- **No Automatic Migration**: Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite requiring manual setup
- **Old Data Preserved**: Previous options remain in database but are not used
- **Setup Required**: After updating, create new Calendar Restrictions through the CPT interface
- **Testing Recommended**: Verify all forms work correctly after migration

### Developer Notes
- **WordPress Standards**: Full compliance with WordPress coding standards and best practices
- **Hook Changes**: Removed old admin hooks, added CPT-specific hooks
- **JavaScript Architecture**: Modular approach with form-specific function scoping
- **Debugging**: Enhanced debugging with detailed logging and utility functions
- **Extensibility**: CPT system provides foundation for future enhancements
